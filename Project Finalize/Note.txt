Note in order to setup in your Computer:
+ reset pom.xml
- select all text in pom.xml and cut then paste it again then save (1)
- if the first step doesn't reload yet run the pom.xml and click mvn build clean

+ set Scenebuilder
- go to Window on the top tab
- go to Preference
- click on Javafx
- on SceneBuilder exetutable find your Scenebuilder.exe file

+ set run argument
- get the argument from javafx document
- just change path to your javasdk library path

Ps.
- after all of the above and it still doesn't work make sure click on each controller file and do same as (pom.xml first step)
- for images and fxml if it doesn't do same as (pom.xml first step)
because this may due to the file doesn't reload properly
